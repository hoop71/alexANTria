# Framework Context

Before modifying framework docs, read:
- [ANT-FRAMEWORK.md](../../ANT-FRAMEWORK.md) — Organizational model
- [ANT-SCHEMA.md](../../ANT-SCHEMA.md) — Technical pattern
- [README.md#philosophy](../../README.md) — Core principles

## Voice and Tone

- Use imperative for requirements
- Use declarative for structure
- Avoid hedging language
- Connect to ant colony metaphor where it clarifies
