# Framework Context

Before modifying framework documentation, read:
- [ANT-FRAMEWORK.md](../../ANT-FRAMEWORK.md) — The organizational knowledge model
- [ANT-SCHEMA.md](../../ANT-SCHEMA.md) — The technical implementation pattern
- [README.md#philosophy](../../README.md) — Core principles

## Quick Reference

- **Intelligence through coordination** — No central brain, alignment via shared constraints
- **Context is load-bearing** — Documentation is substrate, not supplementary
- **Higher constrains lower** — Queen → Nest → Chambers → Tunnels → Surface hierarchy
- **Bidirectional flow** — Signals bubble up, constraints cascade down
- **Read, act, repair** — Every action updates shared memory
- **History matters** — Past decisions explain current structure

## Framework Files

| File | Purpose | Layer |
|------|---------|-------|
| ANT-FRAMEWORK.md | Organizational knowledge model | Queen |
| ANT-SCHEMA.md | Technical implementation pattern | Chambers |
| ANT-EXTERNAL.md | External context feed marker | Meta |

## Voice and Tone

Framework docs establish principles:
- Use imperative for requirements ("must", "always", "never")
- Use declarative for structure ("layers form", "knowledge flows")
- Avoid hedging ("probably", "might", "usually")
- Connect to ant colony metaphor where it clarifies
