# Command Context

Before modifying commands, read:
- [ANT-FRAMEWORK.md](../../ANT-FRAMEWORK.md) — Coordination principles
- [user-level/commands/README.md](../../user-level/commands/README.md) — Command patterns

## Command Philosophy

- Read, act, repair pattern
- No central brain (autonomous workers)
- Small actions scale
- Respect history (manifest, pending log)
- Follow ant-* naming
